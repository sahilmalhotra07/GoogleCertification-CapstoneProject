# GoogleCertification-CapstoneProject
The Cyclistic Case Study is one of the capstone projects of Google Data Analytics, a professional certificate program offered on Coursera. I finished the certificate program recently, working on the case.

I am  data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. 

**Case Study**

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.  Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders

The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. 
Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

**Business Task**

A) Understand the profiles/usage pattern of different types of riders:
  1) Casual: Who purchase a single-ride pass OR a full-day pass
  2) Members: Who Purchase annual member ships
B) Share 3 recommendations based on your analysis and findings to convert casuals to members
